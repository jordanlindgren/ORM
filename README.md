## Objectives

E-Commerce Backend is a backend API (surprise surprise) that makes use of CRUD operations for a general eCommerce website. The API is built with Express.js and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. There are endpoints for categories, tags, and products. Products belong to a single category but can have multiple tags, and tags can be attributed to multiple products.

## Installation instructions

First, download or clone the repository to your local machine. Then, from within the root directory, run:

npm i
to install all the necessary dependencies.

Next, you will need to connect the application to a MySQL database running locally on your machine. First, make sure you have a MySQL server installed and running on your machine. After confirming you have a server runnning, you will need to create a .env file in the root directory to hold your database credentials. You will need to add the following three properties:

DB_USER=<username>
DB_PW=<password>
DB_NAME='ecommerce_db'
Once this is complete, you will need to instantiate the database via the provided schema.sql file. From your root directory, run:

mysql -u <username> -p

and enter your username and password credentials. Then, from inside your MySQL shell, run:

source db/schema.sql // creates the database, or recreates if it already exists.
quit
Optionally, you may seed the database with provided dummy data contained in the /seeds directory by running:

npm run seed

from your root directory.

The application should now be ready for use.

## Usage Instructions

From the root directory, after confirming you've installed all prerequisites and set up the application, run:

npm start
The server will become live and will listen on the default port of 3001. Users can then make requests to three different endpoints:

Categories:

GET /api/categories/
GET /api/categories/:categoryID
POST /api/categories/
PUT /api/categories/:categoryID
DELETE /api/categories/:categoryID

Tags:

GET /api/tags/
GET /api/tags/:tagID
POST /api/tags/
PUT /api/tags/:tagID
DELETE /api/tags/:tagID

Products:

GET /api/products/
GET /api/products/:productID
POST /api/products/
PUT /api/products/:productID
DELETE /api/products/:productID
